    <h1>About ME..</h1><br>

<p>Hello! I'm Rohit Gulab Patil, a passionate backend engineer currently working at Infosys. With 1.8 years of experience, I have honed my skills in backend development, consistently striving to deliver efficient and scalable solutions.</p><br>
<p>I hail from the vibrant city of Jalgaon, Maharashtra, where I completed my schooling. My academic journey took me to Nashik, where I earned my engineering degree. Right after graduation, I embarked on my professional career with Infosys as a fresher, diving into the world of programming and problem-solving with great enthusiasm.</p><br>
<p>Born on December 13, 2000, I have always been driven by a curiosity for technology and a desire to solve complex problems. My role at Infosys allows me to channel this passion into creating robust backend systems that power seamless user experiences. I take pride in my ability to tackle challenges head-on and deliver high-quality code.</p><br>
<p>In addition to my expertise in backend development, I am also exploring the exciting world of frontend development. This journey allows me to gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire development process, enabling me to create more integrated and user-friendly applications.</p><br>
<p>Through my journey, I have developed a strong foundation in various programming languages and frameworks, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and stay updated with the latest industry trends. I believe in the power of continuous learning and enjoy collaborating with like-minded professionals to push the boundaries of what's possible.</p><br>
<p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I'm excited to share my work and experiences with you, and I look forward to connecting with others who share a passion for technology and innovation.</p>
